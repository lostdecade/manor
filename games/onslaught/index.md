**Onslaught!** is the spiritual successor to [Onslaught! Arena][1]. Originally a pure HTML5 game, **Onslaught!** is now available on [iPad][2] thanks to the [Game Closure][3] SDK.

The basic gameplay mechanics, creature behaviors and everything else from [Onslaught! Arena][1] is still here, but we also added **new enemies**, **new environments** and a **store with awesome gear** for your playing pleasure. While it's not _quite_ a sequel, we wanted to add enough new content to be worth a look on these new mobile platforms.
