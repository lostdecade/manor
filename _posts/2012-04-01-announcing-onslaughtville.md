It's no secret that we at Lost Decade Games love playing social games on Facebook. In fact, our dream for this company was to one day build an amazing, innovative game experience woven with social fabric.

Friends, that day has come.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to manage your own medieval fantasy village? Wonder no more!

OnslaughtVille offers hours of engaging gameplay:

* Build shacks, horse stables, outhouses and more as you expand your village!
* Clean chamber pots before your village becomes overwhelmed by the plague!
* Throw goblins at your friend's village!

OnslaughtVille will be built from the ground up on next generation browser technology -- Java Applets. Everyone knows that HTML5 is just a fad.
