This Sunday, August 11th, we'll begin live streaming [Crypt Run](http://www.cryptrun.com/) gameplay on [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/LostDecadeGames). For two hours we'll be talking about Crypt Run, answering questions from the chat, and counting down the final two hours of the [Crypt Run Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richtaur/crypt-run-death-is-just-the-beginning).

Here's the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1399990470218151/). Hope to see you there!
