Hot on the heels of [our initial release of Lava Blade][5], we've just pushed out the first content and bug fix patch! Lava Blade 1.1 is now available on all 3 of the currently released platforms, [Chrome Web Store][2], [PC][3], and [Mac][4]. CWS users should see the update automatically while PC & Mac users can download the new version via their original download link from BMT Micro.

The 1.1 update includes:

* Extended Forest and Swamp zones
* 3 new types of goblins: Sappers, Shaman and Raiders
* 3 new types of Trogs: Slaves, Elites and Cultists
* 2 new, unique boss encounters in the extended Forest and Swamp

In addition to this content update, we've also put [Lava Blade up on Steam Greenlight][1]!
