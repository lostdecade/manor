Were you sad that there [was no Lostcast](https://twitter.com/LostDecadeGames/status/209356076099973120) yesterday? Us too, but this might help: I was recently on an episode of [Laser Time](http://www.lasertimepodcast.com/), a podcast run by games journalogist [Chris Antista](https://twitter.com/#!/CAntista). The episode's called [Make a Video Game](http://www.lasertimepodcast.com/2012/06/04/laser-time-how-to-make-a-video-game/) and we talk about things that might be familiar to [Lostcast](/lostcast/) listeners, like HTML5 and independent game development.

If you missed it, I also co-hosted a recent episode of [VGMPire](http://www.vgmpire.com/), a video game music podcast ran by my friend [Brett Elston](https://twitter.com/#!/Brelston). The episode's called [Shining the Blues](http://www.vgmpire.com/2012/05/23/vgmpire-episode-22-shining-the-blues/) and we talk about a franchise that really influences Lost Decade -- the [Shining series](http://goo.gl/0YxU3)! It even has an exclusive Shining remix from [master of funk Joshua Morse](https://twitter.com/richtaur/status/208442678239707136)!

Tomorrow we're interviewing a Google developer for the next episode of Lostcast. We'll post that episode this upcoming Sunday!
