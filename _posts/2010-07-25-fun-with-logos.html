<p>
	Whenever I have free time to work on game development,
	I always struggle to concentrate on the <strong>game development itself</strong>.
	Sometimes I lose this struggle and I work on something peripheral like
	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/sets/72157624259233822/">logo design</a>.
	That happened recently, and here's what came out of it:
</p>

<p>
	<a
		class="before"
		href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/4693243921/"
	>
		<img alt="Lost Decade Games sign logo" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4693243921_47f9778372_m.jpg">
	</a>
	For some reason I kept picturing the name engraved in gold.
	And I was thinking it would be cool for the logo to look like a <em>ye olde tavern</em> sign,
	like an "INN" sign in <a href="http://rpgclassics.com/">classic RPGs</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't spend much time on this beore I realized I was going in the wrong direction.
	It looks more like a piece of ugly jewelry glued to a sign hanging by thick string.
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
	<a
		class="after"
		href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/4693243401/"
	>

	</a>
	And here's a different approach: an abandoned playground.
	I definitely dig the style
	(I swear some movie company had an animated logo that had a similar look and it was really cool. Anybody know what that is?)
	and I like how it plays on the company name.
	But overall it made me more sad than motivated.
	Maybe &#8230; maybe I am just too sensitive &#8230;
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
	<a
		class="before"
		href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/4693879442/"
	>
		<img alt="Lost Decade Games hourglass logo" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4693879442_ec692f7cc5_m.jpg">
	</a>
	I was actually really pleased with how this concept turned out.
	The hourglass represents the idea from the company name about
	<a href="/why-geoff-failed-and-the-road-to-redemption">lost</a>
	<a href="/why-you-cant-play-matts-dream-game-yet">time</a>,
	and the sand falling on the dragon represents the medieval fantasy game we've been wanting to make.
	The main problem is: how do you make a logo out of that?
	If a <a href="http://www.google.com/logos/official.html">logo is rectangular, it's usually horizontal</a>.
	We could cut out the top portion but then it looks odd, with the glass stopping at the edge of the image.
</p>

<p>
	Plus, the idea of a sundial came up, and that sounded really cool for some reason &#8230;
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
	<a
		class="after"
		href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/4693244353/"
	>
		<img alt="Lost Decade Games sundial (iron) logo" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4693244353_9076dee919_m.jpg">
	</a>
	This was my first shot at the sundial concept.
	I modeled it after an actual sundial we had in our yard while growing up.
	It looks very similar except there was a character where the title is (I think it was the Grim Reaper).
	The idea of making the center piece
	(the part that casts a shadow to tell the time) a sword came late in the design, which I felt made the whole thing come together.
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
	<a
		class="before"
		href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/4693879754/"
	>
		<img alt="Lost Decade Games sundial (copper) logo" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4049/4693879754_0074cc265e_m.jpg">
	</a>
	This is a deeper dive into the initial sundial concept.
	Copper replaced iron because it strikes me as a very medieval-fantasy type of metal
	(probably because it was the first decent
	<a href="http://shrines.rpgclassics.com/nes/dw1/weapons.shtml">weapon to buy in Dragon Warrior</a>).
	Then some texture was added to the face, the hilt of the sword got more design attention,
	and the title was enlarged.
</p>

<p>
	Overall I think we were pretty happy with it, but we collaborated on an idea
	to have a <strong>stone</strong> sundial, where the center piece is actually an
	<strong>axe that was just slammed into the sundial whoooaaaaaa</strong>!
	We thought this was awesomely <em>metal</em> so &#8230;
</p>

<p style="clear: both;">
	<a

	</a>
	Here it is!
	We're really happy with it and we hope it conveys "young company that makes medieval fantasy games for you to enjoy,"
	because that was our goal.
</p>

<p>
	The "Lost Decade Games" text itself hasn't seen much design attention yet;
	I think that's something that we'll iterate on.
	But in the meantime, now we have an image to attach to our
	<a href="http://twitter.com/lostdecadegames">various</a>
	<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/">online</a>
	<a href="http://delicious.com/lostdecadegames">accounts</a>,
	which should satisfy our <acronym title="Obsessive compulsive disorder">OCD</acronym> for now.
</p>

	<strong>Oh boy bonus!</strong>
	I admit there are some designs we're not showing here because they're embarrassingly bad.
	Here's an example: I was exploring the idea of using the name of the company in the design itself,
	and I formed the words into the shape of a sword.
</p>

<p>
	It was a decent idea in my head, but in
	<a href="http://www.mydamnchannel.com/You_Suck_at_Photoshop/Season_1/YouSuckAtPhotoshop1DistortWarpandLayerEffects_1373.aspx">Photoshop</a>
	it looked so bad I thought it deserved a turd for a handle.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, we also recently added a
	<a href="http://www.moddb.com/company/lost-decade-games">developer page on Mod DB</a>
	(and <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/company/lost-decade-games">Indie DB</a>, though I don't understand the difference)
	which had ridiculous logo requirements like image resolutions at:
	<strong>940x360</strong>,
	<strong>950x150</strong> and
	<strong>1024x768</strong>.
	Isn't that odd? Anyway you can see more (huge!) versions of the final logo
	<a href="http://www.moddb.com/company/lost-decade-games">there</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Have you worked on a logo before? What problems did you have and what worked well?
	Or better yet, have you
	<a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/06/Evolution-of-the-Wolfire-Logo">blogged about it</a>
	like the <a href="http://www.wolfire.com/">Wolfire</a> guys?
