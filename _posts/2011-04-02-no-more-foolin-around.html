<p>We've reverted our <a href="http://blog.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught-arena-v1225-is-free-today-only">April Fool's version of Onslaught! Arena</a> back to the game we all know and love. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/khodnfbkbanejphecblcofbghjdgfaih">Chrome Web Store</a> users should see the game update in the next day or so.</p>
<p>We enjoyed the Super Meat Boy mode so much that we've left it in game, accessible via a keyboard code. Simply type <strong>MEAT</strong> anytime during the game to play as <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat Boy</a>!</p>
<p>Additionally, the game still <strong>saves every wave</strong> now. We realize the game is extremely difficult so now attempting the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJscBSbc-aA">Dragon</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvLV2OPbq2E">Beholder</a> over and over until you get it right won't be quite as punishing! :)</p>

<p>We gave away <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onslaught-arena/id418268106">Onslaught! Arena on Mac App</a> store for free yesterday as well and <strong>646 lucky users</strong> snagged a copy! If you liked it please leave a review!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>
