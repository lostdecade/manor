**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games. In episode 18, we answer a listener email about the great **DOM VS Canvas** debate, talk about getting your games out there into HTML5 land, and chat about our next game **Lava Blade**.

We also announce our new sponsor, [Pokki](http://pokki.com/)! Very exciting news, as it allows us to develop bigger, more awesome games. Please do check them out and be sure to get the high score on [Onslaught! Arena on Pokki](https://www.pokki.com/app/Onslaught-Arena).
