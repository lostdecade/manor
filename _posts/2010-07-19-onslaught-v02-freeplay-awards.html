	We've been hard at work the last several weeks improving Onslaught! after <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/our-boing-boing-games-inspired-by-music-entry" target="_self">entering in the Boing Boing contest</a> (Post-mortem coming soon!).
</p>
<p>Now we're entering Onslaught! in the <a href="http://www.freeplay.net.au/2010/06/freeplay-awards/" target="_blank">Freeplay Awards</a>&nbsp;with bunches of bug fixes and gameplay enhancements such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Brief invincibility when you get hit</li>
	<li>Improved the "30 second experience" by giving the player two weapons to start</li>
	<li>You can now cycle through your weapons with Z and X</li>
	<li>Cyclops now throw rocks or energy balls</li>
	<li>Improved the "waves" flow with gates opening/close</li>
	<li>You can now pause the game by pressing P</li>
	<li>Various behind-the-curtains improvements and bug fixes</li>
	<li>Pain and death animations</li>
	<li>Demoblin now gets near you and throws tridents</li>
	<li>New title</li>
	<li>Tweaked the hell out of gameplay</li>
	<li>Added dragon boss!</li>
	<li>Hit point bars for dragon and superclops</li>
	<li>Got rid of rocks in favor of swords</li>
	<li>How to play screen</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Sounds great, right?
