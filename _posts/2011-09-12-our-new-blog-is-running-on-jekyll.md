title: Our new blog is running on Jekyll

Welcome to our new website! As web developers, we've been aware that our site has been a bit ... sad? For entirely too long now. So we rolled up our sleeves, made a brand new design and moved our blog off of [Posterous](http://posterous.com/).

## What's different?

Our new site is hosted via [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) -- a "blog-aware, static site generator." There are several benefits to this setup:

* Jekyll compiles the site once and then only static html files are served making page load times very fast.
* We can deploy changes or make new posts just by committing to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lostdecade/manor).
* Better [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) support which makes Geoff especially happy.

In addition to the above changes we're using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) to write cleaner and more easily maintained CSS.

It looks like we're not the only ones migrating our site to GitHub Pages, either. Check out [this article from Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/09/jekyll-github-pages/) for some great tips on using Jeykll.

## More organized GitHub repos

Our demos and code samples used to all be thrown into our public [manor](https://github.com/lostdecade/manor) repo, but this made for awkward forking and wasn't very clean. Now we've made separate repos for our demos including:

* [Analog Sticks](https://github.com/lostdecade/analog_sticks)
* [Simple HTML5 Canvas Game](https://github.com/lostdecade/simple_canvas_game)

So fork, fork away!

## So long, comments!

We mourn the loss of our comments. Thank you to all who contributed to discussions on our blog, but we hope that moving forward, relying on social networks for interaction with our fans and readers will be adequate. As always, please feel free to [email us](/contact/).

## More stuff coming soon

We'll be making a more substantial page for [Onslaught!](/onslaught_arena/), designing an actual title, and fixing any issues that may arise. What do you think? Do you have a setup for your website that's similar to ours? Let us know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames)!
