title: "Indie life: high quality photos of us making games"

Recently a [friend][1] of a [friend][2] contacted me about doing a photoshoot with us. She's a local photographer and was looking for subjects that would fit a "startups in startup environments" kind of vibe. Naturally, we were game!

So Maki of [Maki Photography][1] came by one afternoon and shot us doin' our thing. We'd be coding or whiteboarding and she'd be running around looking for and taking excellent shots. She has created a [gallery of 36 of these photos][3] on her website.

I've also included a few I liked quite a bit right here; click any image for a high resolution version.
