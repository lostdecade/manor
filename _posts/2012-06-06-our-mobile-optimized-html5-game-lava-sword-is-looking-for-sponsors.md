We recently finished our mobile-optimized HTML5 game called **Lava Sword**. It's a side-scrolling action game designed to be very simple, and it runs great on Android browers and Mobile Safari.

Players progress through a wooded area, wielding a big sword to fight off monsters, all while avoiding spikes and other hazards!

At the end of the game, the player's score (which is based on the number of killed monsters) is displayed. This would be a perfect time to tap into a **High Score API** to give the player bragging rights!

So if you're involved with a games portal who's looking for an HTML5 arcade-style game that runs great on Android/iOS browsers, please do [get in touch](/contact/).
