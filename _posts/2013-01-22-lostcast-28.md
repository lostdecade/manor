## My GitHub Game Off recommendations

> [Release Cycles](http://www.release-cycles.com/) - An abstract, 80s-inspired, brutally difficult arcade game. Players control a little square that revolves around in an expanding and shrinking little circle. It's insanely hard at first, but once you get the swing of it, is pretty enjoyable. People who are into Terry Cavanagh's Super Hexagon may enjoy this one.

> [Avabranch](http://avabranch.zolmeister.com/) - Fun soundtrack, simple visuals. Control colored worms as they travel through a procedurally-generated maze of blocks. The controls change as you collect multiple worms -- the real challenge is when the worms are split and you have to control them separately!

> [PolyBranch](http://gregbatha.com/branches/) - Another minimalist game with satisfying aesthetics. Control a red circle as it makes its way through a randomly generated branch-filled tube. This one put me into a few very satisfying trances!

> [FightCode](http://fightcodegame.com/) - this is a bit hard to get into for non-developers, but the premise is cool. Players enter robots into an arena to battle it out. The robots are controlled by simple commands, such as "move forward" and "attack", which are pre-programmed. Robots then compete statically via the web interface.
