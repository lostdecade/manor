	<strong>Update:</strong> we've taken the Android version down, as the Game Closure SDK is both not currently supporting Android and we do not have access to it. Our sincere apologies for any inconvenience.
</p>

<p>Hot on the heels of our announcement of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onslaught!/id441426241">Onslaught! for iPad</a>, we're now equally as thrilled to announce <strong>Onslaught! for Android</strong>. This is again without any additional code on our part, thanks to <a href="http://gameclosure.com/">Game Closure</a>'s awesome technology. Read all about it in our previous article, <a href="/the-road-to-a-production-quality-html5-game-o">"The road to a production-quality HTML5 game on iOS"</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's currently only compatible with Android tablets, but we are working on a version that will work with Android phones too. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames">Follow us on Twitter</a> to know be notified as soon as it's available!</p>
