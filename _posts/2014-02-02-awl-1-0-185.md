It's been over a week since we launched [A Wizard's Lizard](http://www.wizardslizard.com/), and it's been going fairly well! Our [Steam Greenlight campaign](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=205801629) is currently ranked #80 out of all the games on Greenlight, and we've even seen a healthy dose of sales thanks to attention from [popular](http://www.twitch.tv/cobaltstreak) [streamers](http://www.twitch.tv/lethalfrag/b/499818127).

We've been hard at work zapping bugs and adding new features to keep up with player demand. The latest version has over **50 incremental changes**, including:

## Items
* Be Your Best (book)
* Demon Spear
* Demon Sword
* Detox Potion
* Elvish Tunic
* Heat Axe
* Magic Book
* Mithril Mail
* Scythe
* Self Improvement (book)
* Spiked Lantern
* Spiked armor (5 piece set)
* Vampire Crown

## Features
* "Otter trap"
* Clearer/better stats in menu
* Display total wins/deaths
* Key pentacle health restoration amount off of player magic
* Magic property
* Pick a random character
* Random Zombie Warlord room layouts
* Redesign access to Den of Thieves

â€¦and LOTS of bug fixes/general improvements. Have a request? Please let us know on the [AWL forum](http://forum.lostdecadegames.com/category/1/a-wizards-lizard). GAME ON!
