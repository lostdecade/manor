Today we're happy to announce our new game [Treasure Geoff](http://treasuregoblin.lostdecadegames.com/?geoff=1)!

**Treasure Geoff** is a free, gamepad-enabled, side-scrolling platformer built in HTML5. Players control a nimble [Geoff](/about/#geoff) who explores dangerous caves in search of treasure. The game features tight controls, procedurally generated levels, achievements, and of course, lots of treasure!
