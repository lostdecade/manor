**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games. In episode 9, we talk with flash developer and HTML5 games advocate [Rich Davey](http://www.photonstorm.com/). He's got years of flash game development experience under his belt, so we discuss in great detail the differences between these two similar yet very different development platorms.

Rich is a fascinating guy with a delightful accent so you should totally have a listen!

[Pixel Blast](http://cryset.co.uk/home/p/playgame.php?id=61) is a fun, polished HTML5 game which is pretty interesting because it's made by ["one man games development company"](http://nocturnegames.webs.com/), and also leverages [GameMaker to output to HTML5](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/html5).
