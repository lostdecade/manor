[Pixel Blast](http://cryset.co.uk/home/p/playgame.php?id=61) is a fun, polished HTML5 game which is pretty interesting because it's made by ["one man games development company"](http://nocturnegames.webs.com/), and also leverages [GameMaker to output to HTML5](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/html5).
