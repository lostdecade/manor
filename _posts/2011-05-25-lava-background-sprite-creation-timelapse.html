<p>If you <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames">follow us on Twitter</a> you may already know this, but we've been busy working on a new version of <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena">Onslaught</a>. We're really excited to be preparing the game for iPad, and instead of just delivering a straight-up port we'll be adding a ton of new content.</p>
<p>The new content ranges all over from weapons, monsters and a new boss, but one the most signifcant updates will be four brand new environments. This should be fun: the last stage takes place <em>inside a damn volcano</em>! I've been working really hard to make interesting environments for players to enjoy and thought a timelapse video of their creation might be fun to watch:</p>

<p>Hope you like it; it was a blast to make! And what is that background music? Why, it's a brand new soundtrack by <a href="http://jmflava.com/">Joshua Morse</a>! Players will be treated to at least 5 brand new nuggets of music goodness.&nbsp;If you're a fan of Onslaught, retro games or the iPad, keep you eye on this space! We'll be blogging about our new iPad game hopefully in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>And (though the timelapse doesn't cover everything), here's the final product:</p>
