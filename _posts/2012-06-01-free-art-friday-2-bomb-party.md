title: "Free Art Friday 2: Bomb Party"
author: matt

We've got a lot of unused art laying around here at Lost Decade Games. So last month I [asked on Reddit][1] if there was any interest in monthly free game art, and there was! The first Friday of each month seemed like as good a time as any to upload it, and it's that time again.

This month I'm offering up some quick pixelwork I did for a game concept we were playing with that we were calling **Bomb Party**. Here's the sprite sheet that you're free to use:

<div class="full-frame">
	<a href="/media/images/posts/faf/bomb_party/sheet.png">
		<img alt="Bomb Party sheet" src="/media/images/posts/faf/bomb_party/sheet_x5.png">
	</a>
</div>

[Download the 1:1 pixel sheet here.][2] Use the graphics however you want, but please do credit **Lost Decade Games** somewhere!

If you missed last month's free art, [have a look](/free-art-friday-lemcraft/)!
