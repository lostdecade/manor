**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games. In episode 16, we interview web game pioneer and [Effect Games][1] creator Joseph Huckaby. We talk about all kinds of awesome tech made in the lastâ€¦ 7 years as well as brand new hacks including one revolving around our game [Onslaught! Arena](/onslaught_arena/).
