I'm so excited I can barely type this! Today I get to announce that Lost Decade Games is now an **officially licensed Nintendo developer**! Lifelong dream unlocked!!

We met two awesome Nintendo guys when we were at Casual Connect last week, and they've been very responsive and eager to help. I can't go into detail, but I've been pleasantly surprised by Nintendo's remarkable support.

So given this exciting news, we've updated [Crypt Run](http://www.cryptrun.com/)'s stretch goals to include Wii U. Read all about it on the [Kickstarter update](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richtaur/crypt-run-death-is-just-the-beginning/posts/559411) and please help us spread the word to Nintendo's legions of fans!
