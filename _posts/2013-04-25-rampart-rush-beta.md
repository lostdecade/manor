**Rampart Rush** is our new defensive shoot 'em up. Players control a warrior fighting off hordes of monsters with swords, daggers, shurikens, fireballs, and more! Players can also place buildings in their castle grounds, such as a Weapon Shop to buy more weapons, or a Magic School to learn more powerful magic.
