title: Reviews of 6 Screen Recording Apps for OSX
author: matt
---
<p>
	I've been wanting to make some more videos of <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena">Onslaught! Arena</a> (and other prototypes we've got cooking) so I wanted to get a really good screen video recording app for Mac OSX.
	But before buying utility software I like to do a little research to make sure I get the one best taylored to my needs.
</p>

<h2>Desired features</h2>

<p>
	Since I'll primarily be recording gameplay from our games, I have particular needs in screen recording software, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><em>Easily</em> capture video</strong> -- with a really simple and noninvasive interface.</li>
	<li><strong>No noticeable CPU hit</strong> -- I had issues with <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">Snapz Pro</a> slowing down my computer when I was recording the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJscBSbc-aA">How to beat the Green Dragon</a> video, so I didn't include it in this research.</li>
	<li><strong>Ability to record <em>audio</em> as well as video</strong> -- ideally from the built-in computer's microphone <em>and</em> what's coming out of the speakers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which applications did I review?</h2>

<p>
	These are just some quick reviews (one of them <em>very</em> quick!), but in most of them I've included <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/">screenshots</a> and actual <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lostdecadegames">video</a> recorded with the application. Here they are in the order I reviewed them:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/">Camtasia</a> ($99)</li>
	<li><a href="http://deepit.ru/products/CaptureIt/info/">CaptureIt!</a> ($29.95)</li>
	<li><a href="http://store.shinywhitebox.com/ishowuhd/main.html">iShowU HD Pro</a> ($59.95)</li>
	<li><a href="http://decimus.net/ScreenMimic/">Screen Mimic</a> ($65)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.syniumsoftware.com/screenium/">Screenium</a> ($29)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/">ScreenFlow</a> ($99)</li>
</ul>

<!-- Camtasia -->
<h2>Camtasia</h2>

</a>

<p>
	First I looked at the free trial of <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia/">Camtasia</a> (full version: <strong>$99.00 USD</strong>) and had the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Nice that it's available for PC <em>and</em> Mac.</li>
	<li>Had to install something called <strong>Soundflower</strong> to record audio from the built-in microphone. That's irritating; I'd much rather it be bundled with the software I already had to install. <em>(Note: looks like most of these apps also require <strong>SoundFlower</strong>, so not a huge ding against <strong>Camtasia</strong>.)</em></li>
	<li>Confusing interface. Had to start recording to tell how to set the recording region.</li>
	<li>I don't dig the interface. I'd rather see native OSX checkboxes and other widgets than a bunch of custom graphics.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Here's a quick video I recorded with <strong>Camtasia</strong>. You can hear both the game's audio and my voice clearly:
</p>

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/hBUxzApXqLI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/hBUxzApXqLI?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

<p>
	Overall seems pretty solid and I was happy with the video I recorded. I couldn't find a good way to switch between the microphone VS. speaker audio recordings in the editing software it came with. But I guess that would mostly be done in something else like <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> anyway. I'm not sure that <strong>Camtasia</strong> is the best bang for the buck considering that its price is up to <strong>three times</strong> that of some of its competitors.
</p>

<!-- CaptureIt! -->
<h2>CaptureIt!</h2>

<p>
	Next I tried <a href="http://deepit.ru/products/CaptureIt/info/">CaptureIt!</a> (full version: <strong>$29.95 USD</strong>) and I was immediately confused. The moment I ran the application my entire screen faded a bit and a toolbar appeared in the bottom-left corner of my desktop. (You can see what I mean on the <a href="http://deepit.ru/products/CaptureIt/info/">product page</a>.)
</p>

<p>
	I quit, then reopened the application to give it another shot. This time I figured out how to record video (which took some digging), but I couldn't for the life of me find where it put the movie file. Since it clearly wasn't as intuitive and easy to learn as I wanted, I wrote it off as a failure and moved on to the next application.
</p>

<!-- iShowU HD Pro -->
<h2>iShowU HD Pro</h2>

<a class="after" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5302126632/">
	<img alt="iShowU HD" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5007/5302126632_8fa46da300_m.jpg">
</a>

<p>
	<a href="http://store.shinywhitebox.com/ishowuhd/main.html">iShowU HD Pro</a>'s full version is <strong>$59.95 USD</strong> with a fewer-features version available for <strong>$29.95 USD</strong>. I downloaded the demo, gave it a go, and had the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>An update was required the <em>moment</em> I started the application. While it's nice that it has an <strong>automated update</strong> flow, I'd rather they had included the update in the file I had just downloaded!</li>
	<li>I liked the option to show or hide the mouse icon during recording. <em>(Turns out this is a pretty common feature.)</em></li>
	<li>Would be nice to see meta data when selecting the region to record (such as width/height and X/Y coordinates). This is epecially important since my most common use-case will be wanting to record the <em>exact</em> gameplay region (eg, 1024x768 pixels).</li>
	<li>The interface (see screenshot above) felt too large and clunky for my needs. I don't really want to spend much time with whatever screen-capturing software I end up purchasing; I want it to be largely invisible and just quickly/easily record videos then disappear.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It was really easy to record a test video:
</p>

<iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OUKS3kDdeZg" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>
	<strong>iShowU HD Pro</strong> is not bad but I think the choice in price might hurt its ability to sell copies. I definitely knew I'd need the "Pro" version since (if I understood correctly) the limited version for 50% less doesn't record audio. So that kind of made me feel like I wouldn't be getting as good a deal (it's funny how <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2008/08/8-pricing-strategies-you-can-implement-right-now.html">pricing works</a>, isn't it?)
</p>

<!-- Screen Mimic -->
<h2>Screen Mimic</h2>

<a class="after" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5308732569/">
	<img alt="Screen Mimic" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5043/5308732569_14776689ec_m.jpg">
</a>

<p>
	<a href="http://decimus.net/ScreenMimic/">Screen Mimic</a> (<strong>$65 USD</strong>) was next on my list and I had the following thoughts when using it:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Simple and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5308732569/">noninvasive interface</a>.</li>
	<li>I like how it displays the selection resolution (eg, 640x480 pixels).</li>
	<li><strong>Very</strong> useful that you can export as <code>.swf</code>! Last time I checked I couldn't find anything to easily convert a movie file to flash on a Mac, so I found this feature extra appealing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The recording quality is pretty good too, as you can see in this video I made using the demo:
</p>

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/nIXgMc5VRek?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/nIXgMc5VRek?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

<p>
	My favorite feature of <strong>Screen Mimic</strong> is that it does a great job of staying out of your face. At first it's just an icon in your menu bar. Click it, and the only options displayed are "New Recording" and "Pause Recording" (disabled). Very minimal and definitely appreciated. On the downside, its has fewer options than the competitors in its price range. Based on the other software with similar features I'd say it should be priced about half of what it is.
</p>

<!-- Screenium -->
<h2>Screenium</h2>

<a class="before" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5308732915/">
	<img alt="Screenium" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5130/5308732915_e2dfdfbe8e_t.jpg">
</a>

<p>
	Next up I tried
	<a href="http://www.syniumsoftware.com/screenium/">Screenium</a> (<strong>$29 USD</strong>)
	and immediately liked it.
	The demo is fully-featured except it limits recordings to 30 seconds. Other software in its category might remove features and/or add watermarks to exported videos. Giving me full access to all normal features allowed me to see <em>exactly</em> what I'd be paying for without any uncertainty. Good stuff.</li>
</p>

<p>
	Recording and exporting this video was a breeze:
</p>

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y_FgeZwj_zc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Y_FgeZwj_zc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

<p>
	I have almost nothing but good things to say about <strong>Screenium</strong>:
</p>

<a class="after" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5309320464/">
	<img alt="Screenium" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5045/5309320464_7cabc89483_m.jpg">
</a>

<ul>
	<li>Really nice interface.</li>
	<li>Love the ability to select which audio to record (system audio and/or built-in microphone).</li>
	<li>Really cool that you can include your built-in camera to the screen capture (see lower-left-hand corner in the video)!</li>
	<li>Tons of options regarding Hotkeys.</li>
	<li>Love the simplicity of the export feature; you can just press "OK" to export immediately, or dig in and get pretty advanced.</li>
	<li><strong>So cool</strong> that you can type in exact width/height and X/Y coordinates! As an anal programmer this optional granular control is wonderful.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It's difficult to say why, but I also felt that <strong>Screenium</strong> had excellent usability. All the options were easy to find and in the right place. No task was a chore.
</p>

<!-- ScreenFlow -->
<h2>ScreenFlow</h2>

<a class="after" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5309321144/">
	<img alt="ScreenFlow" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5089/5309321144_7e0e805023_m.jpg">
</a>

<p>
	After trying <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/">ScreenFlow</a> (<strong>$99 USD</strong>), I had the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Immediately got a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5309320690/">translucent window with some recording options</a>. Didn't see any opacity settings; wasn't digging the pre-recording window.</li>
	<li>Upon clicking "Record Computer Audio," was disappointed to be prompted to "Install Audio Driver."</li>
	<li>The first test video I recorded only captured video from my laptop screen and I couldn't find a way to record from the external monitor instead.</li>
	<li>Can also include built-in camera recording in your capture, with many more features like sizing, rotation and position. Very cool, but realistically would probably never get used.</li>
	<li>Has tons of advanced post-capture editing features such as screen stretching and rotating (but I'd rather handle these effects in a different application like <strong>iMovie</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Videos (from both the screen and built-in camera) are easy to record:
</p>

<object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/M36Jb8w6CZs?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/M36Jb8w6CZs?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object>

<p>
	I found <strong>ScreenFlow</strong>'s pre-recording interface to be too minimal and its post-recording interface way too involved. The quality feels pretty good, and even at almost $100 the value might be there for some users. But I'm in the market for a <strong>simple</strong> screen recording app, so as long as it does what I need, the fewer options the better.
</p>

<!-- QuickTime -->
<h2>Bonus: QuickTime</h2>

<p>
	<strong>Edit 1/2/2011:</strong> I gave <strong>QuickTime</strong> (v10.0) a try after <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/osx/comments/eu5j5/reviews_of_6_screen_recording_apps_for_osx_which/">reading that it was available</a> for OSX10.6+. While the price tag (free!) is obviously great, I noticed a CPU hit making my gameplay recording sluggish. I also saw no options for recording only a selected region of the screen. These reasons made it a dealbreaker, but it might be a great free solution for you!
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
	Overall I was the most impressed with <a href="http://www.syniumsoftware.com/screenium/">Screenium</a>. It has a wonderful interface, is easy to use and powerful enough for my purposes (and being the least expensive is a nice coincidence!).
	If <strong>Screenium</strong> wasn't on the plate, I guess my second choice would have been <strong>Screen Mimic</strong>. It does very little but has pleasant controls and is also simple to use.
</p>

<p>
	Do you have your own experiences with screen recording software on Mac OSX? Is there any great software out there that I missed?
