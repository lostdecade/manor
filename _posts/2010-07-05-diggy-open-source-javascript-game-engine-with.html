<p>
	Today I'm happy to announce <a href="http://github.com/richtaur/diggy">Diggy</a>,
	an open source game engine written in JavaScript.
	Embedded below is <a href="http://playbombada.appspot.com/">Bombada</a>,
	a game made with <em>Diggy</em>:

</p>

<h2>More about <em>Diggy</em></h2>

<p>
	The name "Diggy" came from <acronym title="DHTML Game Engine">DGE</a>,
	which stands for <em><acronym title="Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language">DHTML</acronym> Game Engine</em>.
	It's a relatively full-featured game engine meant to empower developers to rapidly produce browser-based games.
</p>

<p>
	You've already seen what <em>Diggy</em> can do, so here's what it is <strong>not</strong>:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>A <a href="http://sizzlejs.com/"><acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</a> selector</a>.</li>
	<li>An event manager.</li>
	<li>A canvas or <acronym title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym> library.</li>
	<li>Useful for standard web apps.</li>
	<li>Meant to do anything but make <acronym title="Document Object Model">DOM</a> games.</li>
	<li>Very stable or ready to make enterprise games.</li>
	<li>Still in development (at least by me).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<em>(There are also <a href="http://github.com/richtaur/diggy">known issues</a> to be aware of.)</em>

<p>
	As you may have
	<a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/why-you-cant-play-matts-dream-game-yet">read previously</a>,
	I'm an amateur game developer.
	I've never shipped a "real" game and <em>Bombada</em> is a baby step towards fixing that.
	Here's more about the project:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Bombada</em> was orginally intended as an <strong>iPhone game</strong> (hence the 480x320 resolution).
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Bombada</em> was also intended to work with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a> (hence <code>match3.js</code> being a separate file and attaching to the <code>exports</code> object).
	</li>
	<li>
		99% of the code was <strong>written from scratch</strong> by me,
		with some exceptions being the easing library
		(borrowed from the
		<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/"><acronym title="Yahoo! User Interface">YUI2</a>
		library)
		and the
		<a href="http://json.org/"><acronym title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</acronym> parser</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		I also made the graphics, which are <strong>free to use</strong> but have some
		<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">Creative Commons</a>
		restrictions.
	</li>
	<li>
		The <strong>music and sound effects</strong> were made by <a href="http://jmflava.com/">Joshua Morse</a>,
		a freelance music composer. Hire him, he's fantastic.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<em>Bombada</em> ended up taking about <strong>7 months</strong> of part-time development.
	But it's not that complex, so why did it take so long?
	Partly because as a fulltime web developer, I don't have a lot of free time.
	But also partly because I was building <em>Diggy</em> along with it,
	so in theory any future games could be built much more rapidly.
</p>

<p>
	I love postmortems, so I may write one up eventually comprised of what worked, what failed, and
	any valuable lessons learned. If that's something that would interest you, please let me know in the comments.

	<strong>Edit 7/6/2010:</strong>
	<em>Bombada</em> composer
	<a href="http://jmflava.com/">Joshua Morse</a>
	has put his excellent original soundtrack
	<a href="http://joshuamorse.bandcamp.com/album/bombada-original-soundtrack">on sale over at Bandcamp</a>.
	It's a steal at just $3 (or more if you're feeling generous).
