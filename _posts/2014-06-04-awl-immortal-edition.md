You knew [A Wizard's Lizard][1] was coming to Steam because it was [greenlit][2] back in February. However! Did you know that there have since been **four additional months** of hardcore development? New content, features, abilities... there's so much stuff we decided to call this update...

**A Wizard's Lizard: Immortal Edition**!

Seriously, look at all this great new stuff:
