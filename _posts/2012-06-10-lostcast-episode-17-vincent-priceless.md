_My apologies for the sound issues; this is our first remote episode. We were at the Googleplex in Mountain View, holding our microphones instead of having them on stands. Because of this we tended to put the mics right in our faces, so the volumes were turned up too much (that's why you may hear clipping). The campus was also going through a bunch of upgrades and construction! We'll do better next time._
