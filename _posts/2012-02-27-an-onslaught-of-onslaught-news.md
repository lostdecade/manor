_Not familiar with the **Onslaught!** games? Check out our post [Onslaught! -- a history of violence (in images)][5]._

## 1. Play for free!

So, first things first: if you haven't already, you should go slay monsters for **free** on one of these fine platforms right now: [Android tablets][6], [iPad][7], [Chrome Web Store][8], [Mac App Store][9] or…

**Onslaught!**'s music composer [Joshua Morse][11] has released the [Onslaught! OST][3] and it's really awesome. You should absolutely go pick it up on Bandcamp right now. Need more evidence? Check out the promo video below:

[Onslaught! Arena][2] is now also [open source][4] on the [Lost Decade Games GitHub page][12]. **Warning!** The code is pretty old at this point and we're both embarrassed by the bad quality of it. But there's still tons of great object and math code in there to read and learn from if you're new to JavaScript or game dev.

We've chosen a GPL (General Public License) for **Onslaught! Arena**. This means you can [fork it][4] and make whatever you want, but it must also be open source. We also retain the rights to all game assets. **tl;dr: make whatever you want with it but you can't sell it.**

_Note that only **Onslaught! Arena** (and not **Onslaught!**) is open source. While the games are just slightly different, **Onslaught!** was built using the [Game Closure][13] SDK and cannot be shared just yet._

## More exciting stuff coming soon

If you dig HTML5 and open source software, you should [subscribe to our blog][14] and/or [follow us on Twitter][15], because I'll be posting about this stuff often. Thanks for reading!

_One final note: if you are one of the fine human beings who purchased the game while it was for sale, we'd like to **thank you** from the bottom of our nerdy hearts. You've kept us going and have given us hope for chasing the indie dream. Thanks for your support!_
