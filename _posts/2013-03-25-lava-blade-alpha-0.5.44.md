We just sent out the latest [Lava Blade][1] alpha to our mailing list. If you signed up and haven't received an email yet, don't worry! We're sending the game out in waves; we have your contact information and will get in touch shortly.

## Want to sign up to alpha test?

If you haven't signed up to be an alpha tester, you can do so by filling out [this form][2].

## Whoa, this is really different!

Yeah, if you played [the previous Lava Blade alpha](/lava-blade-alpha-0.2.1/) you may notice that things are quite different. What was once a side-scrolling platformer is now a turn-based strategy RPG. That's quite a drastic change! Those interested in the reasoning behind this could have a listen to our [recent podcast](/lostcast-29/) where we discussed this.

Game on!
