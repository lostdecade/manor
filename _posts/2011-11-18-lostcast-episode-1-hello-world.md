**Lostcast** is the name of our new podcast! In this first episode we introduce ourselves, chat a little bit about **Lost Decade Games**, talk about the history of [Onslaught!](/onslaught_arena/), and discuss HTML5 games in general. We're not sure yet if it will be weekly, or monthly, or what. We'll figure that stuff out eventually.
