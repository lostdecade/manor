	Our new game <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena">Onslaught! Arena</a> launched mid-afternoon a week ago today in the new <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Google Chrome Webstore</a>. This is a brand-new platform from Google and many people are curious (if not excited) about it, so we thought we'd share our numbers from the first week. <em>Note: We got this data from a combination of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>, Google Checkout, and our own <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/docs/index.html">Licensing API</a> caching system.</em>
</p>

<p>
	First up is the number of unique visitors to our <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/khodnfbkbanejphecblcofbghjdgfaih">Chrome Webstore page</a>:

	Our strongest day was easily Wednesday with <strong>7,750 uniques</strong> and our weakest day was just yesterday (Monday) with only <strong>1,059</strong>. These numbers do seem a bit low for a new product launched by Google, but we are just one game featured in a big store full of apps.
</p>

<p>
	Next up is the number of new players of <strong>Onslaught! Arena</strong>. These are unique users who visited the <a href="http://arcade.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena/">play Onslaught! Arena page</a> and logged in with their Google accounts.

<p>
	So these numbers range pretty wildly, from <strong>863 players</strong> down to just <strong>96</strong>. Lastly, and I'm sure most interestingly, are the number of game sales.

<p>
	So our best days have seen only <strong>5 sales</strong>, but we've had at least one purchase every day. And you may be wondering what our take is out of the <strong>$4.99</strong> price tag. After Google's <a href="https://checkout.google.com/support/sell/bin/answer.py?answer=89800">transaction fees</a>, we get <strong>$4.46</strong> per transaction. So given our <strong>21 sales</strong> so far, that makes for a grand total of <strong>$93.66</strong> in the first week. These comparatively low numbers make some of the <a href="http://www.delicious.com/lostdecadegames/onslaught-arena+press">press</a> we've seen kind of <a href="http://www.gottabemobile.com/2010/12/10/chrome-web-store-sales-almost-non-existant/">humorous</a>:
</p>

<p><blockquote>
	Onslaught Arena has almost 1,300 users, which means its developer has earned about $7,000 in the first week.
</blockquote></p>

<p>
	That article is inaccurate by a large margin. What that says to us is that the "users" and "installs" numbers of the Webstore pages are confusing. On <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/khodnfbkbanejphecblcofbghjdgfaih">our app's page</a>, the numbers displayed are currently <strong>2,337 users - 3,200 weekly installs</strong>. We're not sure exactly what those numbers mean or where they came from, since they don't easily mesh well with the numbers we have.
</p>

<p>
	So we won't exactly be buying yachts anytime soon. But I'll tell you, after <a href="/why-geoff-failed-and-the-road-to-redemption">failing for</a> <a href="/why-you-cant-play-matts-dream-game-yet">so long</a> to publish a "real" game, it feels good to finally be able to call ourselves professional game developers, even if on a tiny scale. (And the game is at least paying its own hosting bills at the moment.)
</p>

<p>
	What do you think? Surprised? Not surprised? Do you have your own numbers from the <strong>Chrome Webstore</strong> that you'd like to share?
