**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games. In episode 25, we talk a bit about the entity/component system we're building for our realtime multiplayer game (project codename: Warhead). We also touch on IE for Xbox 360 and other rambly stuff.

Thanks for the recent feedback! We're settling into the new podcast format and (as you can see) it's enabling us to release more shows.
