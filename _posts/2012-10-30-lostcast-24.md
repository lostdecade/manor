We're back! It's been almost two months and we were really excited about recording today. Fair warning: this episode has a bit of a different format than Lostcast has had so far. Normally I go through and spend hours editing and polishing the podcast, but we're experimenting with a raw cut this time. Our options are pretty much "quick 'n dirty" or "no podcast at all" so I picked the former and I hope you're happy with that.

Either way, feedback is appreciated and super helpful, so please let me know what you think about this episode!
