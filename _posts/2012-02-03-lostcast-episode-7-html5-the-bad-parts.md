**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games.
In episode 7, **we hate HTML5**! … Ok, maybe we actually love it a little _too_ hard, but in this episode we go over all the stuff that developers (via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames) and live conversations) told us that they hate about working with HTML5.

We're going to start spotlighting one HTML5 game each week, starting things off with [Faerie Alchemy](http://subsoap.com/games/faerie-alchemy/html5/) by [Subsoap](http://www.subsoap.com/). We discuss the game in more detail in the 'cast, but the gist is that it's a solid HTML5 game, very appropriate for the platform and quite polished. Check it out!
