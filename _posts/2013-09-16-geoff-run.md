It's Geoff's birthday! He's 96 or something. Here at Lost Decade, it's kind of a tradition to give each other company-branded products (shirts, stickers, etc.), but we're especially poor at the moment, so instead I animated him and stuck him in Crypt Run. What fun!

For Geoff's birthday last year, I [added a sprite of him to Lava Blade](/geoff-lava-bladed/) (a graphic we didn't use until we "launched" [Treasure Geoff](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/play-treasure-geoff/)). We've come a long way since then! At the time, [Lava Blade]() was being built as a side-scrolling platformer, and we now know how that wentâ€¦

In the next build going out soon, [Crypt Run early alpha users](http://www.cryptrun.com/) can type "ldgeoff" and their player avatar will turn into Geoff. Good Geoff-related times are to be had by all. Will we introduce some secret that only Geoff can unlock?!

Be sure to wish Geoff a happy birthday on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffblair) or the LDG [forum](http://forum.lostdecadegames.com/)!
