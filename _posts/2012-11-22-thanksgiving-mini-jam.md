Yesterday, I decided to take a break from bigger projects and challenge myself to a mini game jam. Making a simple game from scratch is a good way to see how our game engine is coming along. I've been wanting to do some holiday themed stuff and Thanksgiving seemed like a good excuse.

I ended up with a really simple "whack-a-mole" style game involving turkeys and pumpkins. I'm pretty happy with how far I got in ~8 hours. The art work is terrible, so you'll probably understand why Matt handles most of our artistic needs!

Without further ado, I present [Turkey Hunt][1]! The game is designed to work best on mobile so try it out on your phone or tablet. Let me know what you think in the comments.

The game ends up being pretty fun, although shallow. Perhaps I can enlist Matt's help in cleaning up the art and other loose ends at some point in the future.

I also want to take this opportunity to wish all our readers and listeners a Happy Thanksgiving! Thanks for your feedback and support on our adventures in indie game development.

Eat lots of great food, enjoy your families and be safe!
