title: "Lunch Bug 1.20.19: tutorial bug fix"

This might be confusing -- there was a bug in [Lunch Bug][1]! While the game does revolve around feeding fruit to the title characters, we don't want there to be any _software_ bugs. This particular bug was a pretty nasty one. Here's what was happening:

<div class="full-frame">
	<a href="http://www.lunchbug.com">
		<img alt="Lunch Bug level 5" src="/media/images/posts/lunch_bug/level_5.jpg" width="500" height="375">
	</a>
</div>

As you can see in the above screenshot, a tutorial window pops up on level 5, explaining the new **Spade** piece. As expected, many players are skipping the tutorials altogether. The problem with level 5 was that the **Store** button is disabled by default, assuming the tutorial would enable it at the appropriate time. But when players skipped the tutorial, the game forgot to enable the **Store** button.

I've fixed this bug in [version 1.20.19][1]. Not sure if you're on the right version? Try refreshing your browser and looking for the version listed on the title screen.

## Lunch Bug is on FIRE!

It's great to be receiving bug reports from users, because that means people are playing the game! Did you see that [Lunch Bug is currently featured on the Chrome Web Store][2]? Well now it's on **FIRE** (whatever that means, but we assume it's a good thing).

If you haven't played it yet, you should right now on [Pokki][3], the [Chrome Web Store][4], or the [open web][5]. It works in modern browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox as well as mobile browsers such as Mobile Safari and the Android browser. Have fun, and keep [reporting][6] those bugs!
