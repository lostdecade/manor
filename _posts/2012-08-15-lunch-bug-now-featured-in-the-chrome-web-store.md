We just received notification from a kindly Googler that [Lunch Bug][1] is now featured in the [Chrome Web Store][2]! It can be seen here on the [homepage][3]:

<div class="full-frame">
	<a href="/media/images/posts/lunch_bug/cws_hp.jpg">
		<img alt="Lunch Bug featured in the Chrome Web Store" src="/media/images/posts/lunch_bug/cws_hp_thumb.jpg">
	</a>
</div>

And also in the [games][4] section:

<div class="full-frame">
	<a href="/media/images/posts/lunch_bug/cws_games.jpg">
		<img alt="Lunch Bug featured in the Chrome Web Store" src="/media/images/posts/lunch_bug/cws_games_thumb.jpg">
	</a>
</div>

Please note that if you are one of the intelligent, attractive players who have already installed Lunch Bug, you won't see it featured when browsing the Chrome Web Store. Not a Chrome user? Lunch Bug is also available on [Pokki][5] and [the open web][6]. Also try it in your mobile browser!
