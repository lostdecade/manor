You can now challenge a friend to see who's better at [Crypt Run](http://www.cryptrun.com/)! Here's how to do it:

1. Visit [cryptrun.lostdecadegames.com](http://cryptrun.lostdecadegames.com/) in a modern browser.
2. Play through the [cemetery dungeon](/media/images/posts/cryptRun/cemetery.jpg).
3. At the [Game Over screen](/media/images/posts/cryptRun/gameOver.jpg), copy the text in the "Challenge URL" input box.
4. Send that URL to a friend via email, Twitter, or carrier pigeon.

Your friend will play the **exact same procedurally-generated dungeon you played**, and your two scores are compared at the end. Instant bragging rights!
