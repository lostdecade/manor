What a crazy couple of weeks! There are only 15 days left in the [Crypt Run Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richtaur/crypt-run-death-is-just-the-beginning), which seemed like a great time for a recap of what's been happening.

With [164 backers](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richtaur/crypt-run-death-is-just-the-beginning/backers), we're currently at **86% of our goal**. Thank you! These promising numbers, combined with our 3-day demo at [Indie Prize Showcase](http://www.indieprize.org/games/index.html) next week, give us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to finish this game for you! To keep the momentum going, we've been pushing hard on updates, includingâ€¦

## Another way to pay

If you're subscribed to our [mailing list](/mailing-list/) or already backing the Kickstarter, you may have heard about Crypt Run's new [Humble Store widgets](http://www.cryptrun.com/buy/). These widgets allow you to use any payment service you prefer, via PayPal or Google Wallet.

## Introducing a new reward tier

Some wonderful people informed us that they wanted to make their mark on Crypt Run, but that the $100 in-game portrait reward was a bit too pricey. We listened, and have introduced a [new reward tier at $50](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/richtaur/crypt-run-death-is-just-the-beginning/posts/547611), for which you get to label a tombstone in a special room in the cemetery dungeon. We don't yet know exactly how this will work, but we'll do something cool with it, promise!

## JumpToGamer interview

I had a great email conversation with [Stefan Richings](https://twitter.com/StefanAnthonyy) of [JumpToGamer](http://www.jumptogamer.com/), which led to this [thoughtful and well-written article](http://www.jumptogamer.com/crypt-run-qa/). Check it out!

## Game Front's Indie Gems spotlight

Oh man, it's so hard to watch someone playing your unfinished game! But I'm still really excited about [Crypt Run's Indie Gems spotlight](http://www.gamefront.com/indie-gems-crypt-run-defies-death-but-not-for-long/) on [Game Front](http://www.gamefront.com/):

## DarkCast podcast

Lastly, good news for [Lostcast fans](/lostcast/): we were on another podcast called [DarkCast](http://www.darkstation.com/darkcast/)! It's over an hour of Crypt Run and general gaming chat, [have a listen](http://www.darkstation.com/darkcast/dci-ep-02-how-to-loose-a-decade/)!

I think that's everything, at least for now. Thanks for reading, and YOU! You have yourself a great weekend! Thanks again for your support!
