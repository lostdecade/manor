My girlfriend, Melissa, is studying to be a [Pasty Chef][1]. One of her recent projects was to create a chocolate box (A box made of chocolate which contains chocolate truffles).

Since she's a big fan of our game [Onslaught! Arena][2], she decorated her chocolate box with characters from the game alongside an awesome looking chocolate LDG axe!

Everything you see pictured is created in chocolate of various kinds. Some parts are modeled by hand while others are molded or tempered.

The moss is made by pouring tempered chocolate over green disco sugar. I think it looks amazing!

We hope you enjoy the game in chocolate as much as we do!

The box *was* filled (past-tense, because I ate most of them!) with the delicious truffles you see below!
