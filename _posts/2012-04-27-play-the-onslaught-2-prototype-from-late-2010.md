During our recent [interview with Dominic Szablewski](/lostcast-episode-14-quite-an-impact/), we remembered that at one point we were using his game engine [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/) to build our games.

A lot's happened since then… we had to [abandon](/details-about-our-next-game-burn-tactics/) some projects, [pivot a few times](/the-road-to-a-production-quality-html5-game-o/), and these days we're using our own in-house game engine called **djinn**.

But some prototypes have survived from our earlier days that we thought ImpactJS users might find helpful to play with. Here's an early prototype of a tenative sequel to [Onslaught! Arena](http://arcade.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena/) that we were calling **Onslaught! 2**:

You'll have to [purchase a license](http://impactjs.com/buy-impact) to use ImpactJS, but once you do, you can [fork the Onslaught! 2 source](https://github.com/lostdecade/onslaught2_impact) and go to town (literally)!

The code is MIT-licensed and the graphics are "use-for-whatever-but-not-commercially". Boy I need to read more about licenses soemday… Enjoy!
