title: "Free-to-use graphics made by my brother in 1996"

I've wanted to make an epic oldschool RPG for as long as I can remember. The first language I ever learned was QBASIC, which was about the worst environment for a huge RPG as I can imagine. But that didn't deter me, and I set to work on what I called DRAGON (pretty creative title, right?).

Earlier this year I found some of my old QBASIC source code and began ["translating" it to JavaScript][1]. An unfinished version (of the unfinished game) is [playable in your browser][2].

During this process I was admiring my brother's artwork, which got me thinking that some game developers out there might like to have access to some fun little medieval fantasy sprites. So here they are, free to use in any project, commercial or otherwise:

<div class="full-frame">
	<img alt="Sprites for DRAGON by Mike Hackett" src="/media/images/posts/free_graphics_1996/DRAGON_by_Mike_Hackett_x3.png">
</div>

* [Download DRAGON spritesheet with black blackground][3]
* [Download DRAGON spritesheet with alpha transparency][4]

_Also: It's not necessary of course, but if you do use them, I'd love to see them in action. So send me your project and I'll check it out!_
