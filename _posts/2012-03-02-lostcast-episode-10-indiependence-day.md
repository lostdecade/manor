**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games. Join us in episode 10 as we celebrate our **indiependence**! (Bad pun, I know.) So we've gone indie and we talk a little bit about what this entails.

There was also [big Onslaught/Arena news][3] this week and we talk all about that too! Don't forget to [subscribe on iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/lostcast/id481950724) and we've also now got [all Lostcast episodes up on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/lostdecadegames)!
