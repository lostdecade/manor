While Android users have been able to play [Lunch Bug](http://www.lunchbug.com/) in their mobile browsers since its launch, the game runs pretty slowly on some devices, and the sound is severely handicapped in the mobile browser. Now, thanks to [CocoonJS](http://ludei.com/tech/cocoonjs), Lunch Bug runs beautifully, sounds great, and can be played without an Internet connection on Android devices.

As always, we're happy to hear what you think! If you experience any issues with the game on your device, please comment below or [contact us directly](/contact/).

Those of you at the [Introduction to the Ludei HTML5 Mobile Game Dev Platform](http://www.meetup.com/Ludei-HTML5MobileGames/events/81752832/) meetup yesterday already heard Geoff talking about his experience with CocoonJS. If you missed it, they'll be posting pictures (and I think video) soon. See you at the next meetup?
