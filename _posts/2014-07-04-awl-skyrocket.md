Whether you celebrate July 4th or not, independence is a grand thing. We here at Lost Decade Games care deeply about independence, and indie games are a fun way to express that.

To celebrate properly, we've added a new Skyrocket weapon to [A Wizard's Lizard](http://www.wizardslizard.com/). It's available for purchase in town. If you can't afford it yet, you might need to explore the dungeons to see if any grateful hostages might contribute to your causeâ€¦

Happy 4th, happy gaming, and thanks for all your incredible support!
