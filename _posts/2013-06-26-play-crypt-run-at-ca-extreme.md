Want to play our upcoming game [Crypt Run][1]? Then you should come to our <strong>LIVE DEMO</strong> next month!

# What?!

[California Extreme][2] is an annual arcade and pinball convention held in the California bay area. It's basically a huge room packed with tons of classic arcade cabinets (it's super awesome).

This year, we'll have an 8-foot table (that's ~2.5 meters for our Metric friends) with at least one computer set up to play an early preview of [Crypt Run][1]. We'll be giving out stickers, high-fives, and possibly some other cool stuff.
