**Free Art Friday** is a monthly _graphics giveaway_ I'm experimenting with. We've got a bunch of unused art sitting around, collecting digital dust. So why not give it to the community? If there's enough interest, I'll be doing more of theseâ€¦

So while working with [Game Closure](http://gameclosure.com/) I had some downtime to learn their SDK, so I built an entire game from scratch in about a week. It's a casual puzzle side-scrolling game I called **Lemcraft** (since it's essentially [Lemmings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game)) meets [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/)).

In **Lemcraft**, players tap the terrain to destroy it, then they can place gathered material in other areas to help the lemmings get to the end of the level.

Anyway it's gone now, lost in the abyss of stealth mode, API breakage and other stuff I won't get into. But the graphics remain! So here they are for your enjoyment and usage.
