**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games. In episode 12, we chat with [Tankworld][1] developer Arno van der Vegt. Arno is a veteran HTML5 game developer as well as a performance expert. He currently works at Game Closure doing work on their cross-platform SDK.

_Note: sorry about the low quality audio… we need better interview hardware!_
