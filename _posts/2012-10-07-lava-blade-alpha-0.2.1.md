We just sent out the [Lava Blade][1] alpha to the first batch of fine players who signed up to be alpha testers. To help spot critical issues early, we're contacting alpha testers in waves. So if you signed up and haven't received an email yet, don't worry! We have your contact information and we'll get in touch shortly.

## What's next?

There's still so much to do. This is just an early alpha! The next change we'll be implementing is a complete overhaul of the attack mechanic (to us, it currently feels weak and unsatisfying). After that, the game is in desperate need of a tutorial.

On top of all this, we just entered production on our next game! (More on that soon.)

## Help test Lava Blade

If you haven't signed up to be an alpha tester, you can do so by filling out [this form][2].

Game on!
