**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games.
In episode 3, we ramble incoherently about ways to help lock down your HTML5 game's source code.
You may notice that this episode is significantly shorter than the previous two: this is based on popular feedback from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames). Also based on feedback, we did not include background music this time around.
