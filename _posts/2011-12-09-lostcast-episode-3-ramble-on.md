In episode 3, we ramble incoherently about ways to help lock down your HTML5 game's source code.
You may notice that this episode is significantly shorter than the previous two: this is based on popular feedback from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/lostdecadegames). Also based on feedback, we did not include background music this time around.
