Yes indeed, the [Lava Blade alpha](/join-the-lava-blade-alpha-test/) is still going on. We're swamped with other projects, but we're eager to dive back into the game, especially after having received so much excellent feedback.

On that note, my lovely wife Andrea (a professional user researcher) has compiled some of the feedback we have so far and is beginning to examine it. Just for fun, she made [word clouds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud) out of some of the open-ended survey questions.

This data isn't really all that useful from an actual research perspective, but I think it's pretty cool to look at. It's interesting that it can give you a slight feel for the game without even having played it.

Lastly, there's this pretty large [overall game pacing](/media/images/posts/lava_blade/words/overallgamepacinggoalsenemybehavior.png) image that wouldn't fit into our narrow blog.

We're neck-deep into development of a realtime multiplayer game so I need to get back to the grind. You might too, if you're competing in the [GitHub Game Off](https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off) competition I'm judging!

On a side note, tomorrow's the one year anniversary of [Lostcast](http://lostcast.fm/) and we're posting an extra-long podcast to celebrate. Hope to see your ears there!
