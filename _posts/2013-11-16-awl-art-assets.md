We're working hard on finishing [A Wizard's Lizard][1] (previously [Crypt Run][2]) and I thought it might be fun to visualize how much content this game has so far. Below are incomplete samplings of some of the monsters, objects, traps, weapons, and characters we've added so far:

## Monsters

</div>

There are currently over **30 monsters** in A Wizard's Lizard, and we haven't even finished the boss encounters yet!

## Objects
<div class="full-frame">

	</a>
</div>

Objects include stuff like barrels, chests, treasure, tables, pots, jars… fun thematic stuff!

## Traps
<div class="full-frame">

	</a>
</div>

These are the elements in the game that players might not be forced to deal with, but can be quite dangerous if they do!

## Weapons
<div class="full-frame">

	</a>
</div>

Who doesn't love a good weapon?! A Wizard's Lizard has swords, axes, daggers, lances, boomerangs, shovels, tridents… you name it!

## Characters

We're only just now starting to flesh out characters with actual stories and player interaction, but we frontloaded a bunch of the artwork for them.

We'll be releasing a beta build of [A Wizard's Lizard][1] to ALL preorders next week, so be sure to [preorder][1] if you haven't yet! This build will also include a bunch of [Kickstarter][2] backer paintings, for which I'll probably make another post. Fun times ahead!
