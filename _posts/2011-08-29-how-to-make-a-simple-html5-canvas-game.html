<p>
	Since releasing <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena/">Onslaught! Arena</a>,
	I've had many requests for a very basic tutorial on how to make a simple game in canvas.
	After pondering for some time how to best approach this complex subject,
	I decided just to put together the <em>very simplest</em> game I can imagine and walk through it practically line-by-line.
</p>

<p>
	So here it is!
	Let's jump right in by walking through
	<a href="https://github.com/lostdecade/simple_canvas_game/blob/master/js/game.js">game.js</a>.
	You can also <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/demos/simple_canvas_game/">play the game right here</a>.

</a>

<h2>1. Create the canvas</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Create the canvas
var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
canvas.width = 512;
canvas.height = 480;
document.body.appendChild(canvas);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	The first thing we need to do is create a
	<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/canvas_tutorial">canvas element</a>.
	I did this in JavaScript instead of HTML to demonstrate how easily it is accomplished.
	Once we have the element we get a reference to its context,
	set its dimensions and append it to the document's body.
</p>

<h2>2. Include images</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Background image
var bgReady = false;
var bgImage = new Image();
bgImage.onload = function () {
	bgReady = true;
};
bgImage.src = "images/background.png";
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	A game needs graphics! So let's load up some images.
	I wanted to do this as simply as possible so it's just an <code>Image</code> instead of being wrapped up in a nice Class or something.
	<code>bgReady</code> is used to let the canvas
	know when it's safe to draw it, as trying to
	<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2923564/uncaught-error-index-size-err">render it before it's loaded will throw a DOM error</a>.
</p>

<p>
	We do this for each of the three graphics we need:
	<a href="https://github.com/lostdecade/simple_canvas_game/blob/master/images/background.png">background</a>,
	<a href="https://github.com/lostdecade/simple_canvas_game/blob/master/images/hero.png">hero</a>
	and <a href="https://github.com/lostdecade/simple_canvas_game/blob/master/images/monster.png">monster</a>.
</p>

<h2>3. Game objects</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Game objects
var hero = {
	speed: 256, // movement in pixels per second
	x: 0,
	y: 0
};
var monster = {
	x: 0,
	y: 0
};
var monstersCaught = 0;
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	Now we define some variables we'll need to use later.
	<code>hero</code> gets setup with <code>speed</code> which is how fast it'll move in pixels per second.
	<code>monster</code> won't move so it just has coordinates.
	Lastly, <code>monstersCaught</code> stores the number of monsters the player has caught.
</p>

<h2>4. Player input</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Handle keyboard controls
var keysDown = {};

addEventListener("keydown", function (e) {
	keysDown[e.keyCode] = true;
}, false);

addEventListener("keyup", function (e) {
	delete keysDown[e.keyCode];
}, false);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	Now for input handling.
	This is probably the first part that will trip up developers who come from a web development background.
	The important thing to remember is that we don't necessarily want to react to an input event right when it happens.
	In the web stack, it may be appropriate to begin animating or requesting data right when the user initiates input.
	But in this flow, we want our game's logic to live solely in once place to retain tight control over when and if things happen.
	For that reason we just want to store the user input for later.
</p>

<p>
	To accomplish this we simply have a variable <code>keysDown</code> which stores any event's <code>keyCode</code>.
	If a key code is in the object, the user is currently depressing that key. Simple!
</p>

<h2>5. New game</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Reset the game when the player catches a monster
var reset = function () {
	hero.x = canvas.width / 2;
	hero.y = canvas.height / 2;

	// Throw the monster somewhere on the screen randomly
	monster.x = 32 + (Math.random() * (canvas.width - 64));
	monster.y = 32 + (Math.random() * (canvas.height - 64));
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	The <code>reset</code> function is called to begin a new game, or level, or whatever you'd like to call it.
	It places the hero (the player) in the center of the screen and the monster somewhere randomly.
</p>

<h2>6. Update objects</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Update game objects
var update = function (modifier) {
	if (38 in keysDown) { // Player holding up
		hero.y -= hero.speed * modifier;
	}
	if (40 in keysDown) { // Player holding down
		hero.y += hero.speed * modifier;
	}
	if (37 in keysDown) { // Player holding left
		hero.x -= hero.speed * modifier;
	}
	if (39 in keysDown) { // Player holding right
		hero.x += hero.speed * modifier;
	}

	// Are they touching?
	if (
		hero.x <= (monster.x + 32)
		&& monster.x <= (hero.x + 32)
		&& hero.y <= (monster.y + 32)
		&& monster.y <= (hero.y + 32)
	) {
		++monstersCaught;
		reset();
	}
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	This is the <code>update</code> function and is called every single interval execution.
	The first thing it does is checks the up, down, left and right arrow keys to see if the user has pressed them.
	If so, the hero is moved in the corresponding direction.
</p>

<p>
	What may seem odd is the <code>modifier</code> argument passed into <code>update</code>.
	You'll see how this is referenced in the <code>main</code> function, but let me first explain it here.
	<code>modifier</code> is a time-based number based on 1.
	If exactly one second has passed, the value will be 1 and the hero's speed will be multiplied by 1, meaning he will have moved 256 pixels in that second.
	If one half of a second has passed, the value will be 0.5 and the hero will have moved half of his speed in that amount of time.
	And so forth.
	This function gets called so rapidly that the <code>modifier</code> value will typically be very low,
	but using this pattern will ensure that the hero will move the same speed no matter how fast (or slowly) the script is running.
</p>

<p>
	Now that we've moved the hero according to the player's input, we can check to see what happened with that movement.
	If there was a collision with the hero and monster, that's it! That's pretty much the game.
	We tally the score (+1 to <code>monstersCaught</code>) and reset the game.
</p>

<h2>7. Render objects</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Draw everything
var render = function () {
	if (bgReady) {
		ctx.drawImage(bgImage, 0, 0);
	}

	if (heroReady) {
		ctx.drawImage(heroImage, hero.x, hero.y);
	}

	if (monsterReady) {
		ctx.drawImage(monsterImage, monster.x, monster.y);
	}

	// Score
	ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(250, 250, 250)";
	ctx.font = "24px Helvetica";
	ctx.textAlign = "left";
	ctx.textBaseline = "top";
	ctx.fillText("Goblins caught: " + monstersCaught, 32, 32);
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	Games are more fun when you get to see the action going down, so let's draw everything to the screen.
	First we take the background image and
	<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial/Using_images">draw it to the canvas</a>.
	Repeat for the hero and monster.
	<em>Note that the order is important, as any image drawn to the surface will be drawn over the pixels under it.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Next we change some properties on the context related to how to draw the font, and we make a call to <code>fillText</code> to display the player's score.
	As we don't have any complicated animations or movement, we're done drawing.
</p>

<h2>8. The main game loop</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// The main game loop
var main = function () {
	var now = Date.now();
	var delta = now - then;

	update(delta / 1000);
	render();

	then = now;
};
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	The main game loop is what controls the flow of the game.
	First we want to get the current timestamp so we can calculate the delta (how many milliseconds have passed since the last interval).
	We get the modifier to send to <code>update</code> by dividing by 1000 (the number of milliseconds in one second).
	Then we call <code>render</code> and record the timestamp.
</p>

</em></p>

<h2>9. Start the game!</h2>

{% highlight js %}
// Let's play this game!
reset();
var then = Date.now();
setInterval(main, 1); // Execute as fast as possible
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
	Almost there, this is the last code snippet!
	First we call <code>reset</code> to start a new game/level.
	(Remember that this centers the hero and places the monster randomly for the player to find.)
	Then we seed our timestemp (with the variable <code>then</code>) and start the interval.
