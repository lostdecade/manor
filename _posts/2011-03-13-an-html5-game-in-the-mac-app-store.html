title: An HTML5 game in the Mac App Store

	HTML5 is the development buzzword of the moment.
	It's the "ajax ninja" of the last few years, so naturally it comes with its fair share of skepticism.
	Indeed, many have been writing about its seemingly
	<a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/11/01/20/206206/No-More-Version-Numbers-For-HTML">never-ending spec</a>,
	<a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=html5">inconsistent implementations</a> by browser makers,
	and even its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/30/joe-hewitt-web-development/">inferiority to native apps</a>.
	All are valid arguments against betting a real business on HTML5.

<p>
	However, here's a hard example of why you absolutely <em>should</em> consider serious development in HTML5.
	In December of last year,
	<a href="/announcing-onslaught-arena-for-sale-in-the-go">we launched</a> our little pure-HTML5 game
	<a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena">Onslaught! Arena</a> in the Google Chrome Webstore.
	Sales <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/04/sales-have-slowed-to-a-trickle-on-googles-chrome-web-store/">could be better</a>,
	sure, but we also just launched the <em>exact same game</em> in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onslaught-arena/id418268106">Mac App Store</a>.
	The code is identical with negligible development time required to port it over to a completely different platform.
</p>

<p>
	Think about the business case for that. Normally it would take considerable resources to port a game to such a different platform.
	We know our game isn't exactly a AAA title, but if programmed from the ground up in Objective-C, our best guess is it would take a few <em>months</em> to develop.
	That's time that we can now spend on content updates or even a sequel.

<p>
	How was it done?
	We just <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/WebKit/Classes/WebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html">embedded a WebView</a> in a native Cocoa app using Xcode.
	Is it inferior? Not noticeably so.
	On my MacBook Pro, the <a href="http://goo.gl/ICa5u">Chrome Web Store version</a> ranges from about 50-250 FPS (frames per second) depending on how many monsters are on the screen.
	On the same computer, the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onslaught-arena/id418268106">Mac App Store version</a> ranges from 30-100 FPS.
	(You can see this for yourself: <strong>type "lddebug"</strong> while in-game to see debug information.)
	And despite <a href="http://www.phoboslab.org/log/2011/03/the-state-of-html5-audio">nasty HTML5 audio issues</a>, sound plays great in both versions.
</p>

<p>
	Surprisingly, the Chrome version runs faster than the native Mac version.
	While Safari and Chrome are both using WebKit as their rendering engines,
	Chrome is likely faster because <a href="http://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> has wicked speed and its canvas rendering is <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/09/unleashing-gpu-acceleration-on-web.html">hardware-accelerated</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Either way, it runs great on both platforms and required almost no dedicated development time to port.
	If you're a developer, you should find this exciting. We certainly do!
