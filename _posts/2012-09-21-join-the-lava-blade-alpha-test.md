We've been making steady progress on our next game, <a href="http://www.lavablade.com">Lava Blade</a>. With the game nearing alpha test readiness, we're in need of brave souls to test out the game and provide feedback and bug reports.

If you'd like to receive email updates with playable alpha test links please [signup][1]. We promise to keep your email private and we'll never spam you or sell your address. Please see our [privacy policy][2] for more information.

The alpha should be ready in the next week or two so expect an email from us around that time.
