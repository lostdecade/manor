**About the photo:** We've decided we're taking shots before Lostcast, since it loosens us up and gets the conversation flowing easier. While we didn't _drink_ mojitos, that is Mojito's head coming in from the right. But no Geoff had Maker's Mark and I had what I call a mini White Russian? Or a White Russian shot? I'm sure this already existsâ€¦
