**Lostcast** is our podcast about HTML5 games. In episode 13, we talk about all kinds of crazy crap, from our GitHub woes to the recent Mozilla game [BrowserQuest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/). But primarily I drill Geoff on how/why his OS X experience is really quite streamlined (and better than mine!).

**About the photo:** We've decided we're taking shots before every Lostcast, since it loosens us up and gets the conversation flowing easier. While we didn't _drink_ mojitos, that is Mojito's head coming in from the right. But no Geoff had Maker's Mark and I had what I call a mini White Russian? Or a White Russian shot? I'm sure this already existsâ€¦
