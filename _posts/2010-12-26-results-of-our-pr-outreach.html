	New games are released every single day, often from big publishers or known developers with long track records of successful titles. So getting the attention of potential gamers who might like to play our <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena">little indie game</a> is difficult to say the least.
</p>

<p>
	Given a small to nonexistent marketing budget, we think the key is to release the best product you can, be really noisy about it, and attempt to enlist the help of popular gaming news outlets to reach gamers. So we put together an official <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/assets/onslaught_arena_press_kit.zip">press kit</a> with a press release, images, screenshots, etc., and tried contacting about three dozen different gaming news organizations. Here we've compiled the responses (or lack of responses) we received.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Note: Many of these video game news organizations are constantly inundated with information and requests for reviews and we understand that they couldn't possibly respond to everyone (especially small potatoes like us). Either way we thought the data might be useful to other indie developers or interested parties.</em>
</p>

<h2>Responded and posted</h2>

<p>
	These are the fantastic, extremely helpful people that not only responded to us but were good enough to help in our attempt to reach gamers who might enjoy <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/khodnfbkbanejphecblcofbghjdgfaih">Onslaught! Arena</a>.

		<a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a> - We got the idea for the first iteration of <strong>Onslaught!</strong> from <strong>BoingBoing</strong>'s <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/06/14/games-inspired-by-mu.html">Games Inspired by Music</a> contest. So we thought it was particularly awesome of them to <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/12/08/onslaught-arena-feat.html">post about our game</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BoingBoing/status/12719608712663040">tweet</a> it to their impressive 65,000+ followers.

		<a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/">GamesRadar</a> - My long-time friend <a href="http://twitter.com/brelston">Brett</a> wrote about the <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/onslaught-arena/news/google-chrome-web-store-is-live-tons-more-indie-games-now-up-for-grabs/a-2010120794414476076/g-2010120794118560087">Chrome Webstore</a>, complete with an awesomely huge sceenshot from <strong>Onslaught!</strong>. He also mentioned the game on his popular <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com/f/talkradar-132-platinum-hits/a-2010121715428577000">TalkRadar</a> podcast. Very cool!
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://www.indiegamenews.com/">Indie Game News</a> - We were really happy to see two stories posted about <strong>Onslaught!</strong> -- both a <a href="http://www.indiegamenews.com/2010/12/onslaught-arena-launched-with-google.html">our press release</a> and <a href="http://www.indiegamenews.com/2010/12/thoughts-on-onslaught-arena.html">quick review of the game</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://onevideogameaday.com/">One Video Game a Day</a> - <a href="http://onevideogameaday.com/about">Dusan</a> was awesome enough to find and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/1videogameaday/status/23114830498">tweet</a> about our earlier demo of <strong>Onslaught!</strong>, and that didn't stop him from <a href="http://twitter.com/1videogameaday">doing it again</a> about the full version of our game. Very cool and much appreciated!
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Responded, nothing posted yet</h2>

<p>
	These kind folks have responded but we haven't yet seen anything posted about our game. We have no complaints or anything -- the holidays are especially busy and we were grateful just to hear back. (And we'll be sure to update this list once the posts are up.)

<h2>No response</h2>

<p>
	Again, we don't have any delusions -- we know we're a tiny, unknown developer and some organizations are too busy to respond to us or spend their time on our little game. So it's cool and all that, but for data's sake here's the list of who we contacted and never heard a peep from:
</p>

<h2>No response, disappointed</h2>

<p>
	Now, I stand by what I said earlier about understanding that folks are busy and we're aware of our minimal place in the industry. But for one reason or another we were really hoping on hearing back from the following list of organizations and were disappointed not to:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>gametunnel</li>
	<li>Gamer Limit</li>
	<li>
		IndieGames --
		<strong>Edit: 12/28/10</strong> -- Heard back in the comments. Thanks Mike!
	</li>
	<li>indienerds</li>
	<li>IndieReview</li>
	<li>
		Mozilla <em>(they're not a gaming news site but they've got an <a href="https://gaming.mozillalabs.com/">HTML5 games contest</a> going on right now and have been <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/mozlabs/status/15816539060051968">tweeting about</a> other games so we were hoping for at least a quick tweet about ours)</em>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So in some cases kind of a bummer, but no hard feelings and we still love you guys!

<h2>Summary</h2>

<a class="after" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5281233302/">
	<img alt="Onslaught! Arena featured on the Chrome Webstore homepage!" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5250/5281233302_f99499e9a7_m.jpg">
</a>

<p>
	For a brand-new developer, I'd say our expectations were about met (save for the prior list). It looks like a little more than <strong>8%</strong> of those we contacted have posted about our game, and we heard back from about <strong>one third</strong>, which is a good start. Here's to hoping that next time around we'll have a bigger, better game and will be fortunate enough to reach a bigger audience!
</p>

<p>
	<em>Our extra special hats off to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for being a <strong>huge</strong> help and an amazingly supportive contact. They even <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/5281233302/">featured us</a> on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Webstore homepage</a>! So awesome.</em>
</p>

<p>
	Did we miss anyone? This data is really hard to keep track of! If we messed up anywhere above, please do let us know and we'll be happy to amend the details (and thanks for your support!).
