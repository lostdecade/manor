<p>
	<em>Update: we had to change plans, so Burn Tactics is no longer under development.</em>
</p>

<p>
	We recently started developing our next game, tentatively called <strong>Burn Tactics</strong>.
	The concept is a turn-based medieval fantasy strategy game where players control a vengeful dragon who's intent on burning down villages and seeking havoc on the kingdom.
</p>

<p>
	While we're still very early in development, we've already made wireframes for every screen in the game and have figured out how the interface will flow in its entirety. As you can see from the included images, we'll be periodically uploading (really rough and ugly!) <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/50655575@N03/sets/72157625840334334/">screenshots of our progress</a>.
	We even have some game code written; we're using the <strong><a href="http://impactjs.com/">impact</a> HTML5 game engine</strong> and are so far really liking it.
</p>

<h2>Why we chose to work on this game</h2>

<p>
	We've had probably a dozen ideas for what to work on next including puzzle games, RTS games, or even a sequel to <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/onslaught_arena">Onslaught! Arena</a>. Among all these directions we could go, we decided to work on <strong>Burn Tactics</strong> for the following reasons:
</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

</a>

<p>
	Though many players are enjoying <strong>Onslaught! Arena</strong>, we've also heard that some of them are turned off by certain features, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Retro look and feel</strong>: the 8-bit graphics and sound are very appealing to some players (including us!) but many aren't familiar with and/or nostalgic about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">NES</a>-era games or just think it's overplayed as an art direction.</li>
	<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: very difficult, requires quick reflexes and excellent dexterity. (Even our girlfriends don't want to play it because it requires twitch skills they don't enjoy learning and so never acquired!)</li>
	<li><strong>Controls</strong>: we've heard <em>many</em> complaints about all kinds of problems with the controls. They're too complicated (with mouse and keyboard options), too buried (not exposing all keyboard shortcuts in the UI) and not customizable (giving non-QWERTY users a headache). <strong>Burn Tactics</strong> will have a simple click/touch-only interface.</li>
	<li><strong>Sluggish performance</strong>: <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> users currently have hardware-accelerated graphics in <strong>Onslaught! Arena</strong>, which certainly helps, but tons of monsters and weapons on-screen can be very taxing on older computers and browsers (making it easy to die and very frustrating).</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<strong>Burn Tactics</strong> is a concept that shouldn't have these problems, so hopefully it'll appeal to a larger audience of gamers.
</p>

<h3>Small in scope</h3>

<p>
	As you may have <a href="/why-geoff-failed-and-the-road-to-redemption">read</a> <a href="/why-you-cant-play-matts-dream-game-yet">before</a>, we both have bad habits of letting our game concepts explode into unclimbable mountains. Given that, our mantra for <strong>Burn Tactics</strong> is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ridiculously simple turn-based strategy game.</li>
	<li>Keep it simple.</li>
	<li>Polish, polish, polish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mobile-friendly</h3>

<p>
	While we would <strong>love</strong> to get <strong>Onslaught! Arena</strong> onto mobile platforms such as Android and iPad, there are many hurdles and in some cases, brick walls. Conversely, <strong>Burn Tactics</strong> is being designed from the ground up to make it feasible to get onto mobile/touch devices. This is great because releasing <strong>Onslaught! Arena</strong> onto these devices has been one of our most common requests.
</p>

<h2>We're still working on Onslaught! Arena</h2>

<p>
	We've got some <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/support">issues</a> we're looking into fixing and we're also trying to get <strong>Onslaught! Arena</strong> into the new Mac OSX App Store.
