title: "Geoff's Awesome OS X Software List"

Here's a list of great OS X apps I use on a frequent basis. A few are free, but most are paid and worth it!

We recorded a [lostcast episode about OS X apps][20] as well.

Many of these apps are also available from the [Mac App Store][21].

## [1Password][1]

1Password is an excellent password manager and one the apps that I don't know how I ever lived without. It's got great organization features and can store other bits of sensative information such as credit card numbers and software licenses.

I create unique, complex passphrases for various sites so that if any particular service is hacked I don't need to change a bunch of different passwords.

Dropbox can be used to store your 1Password keychain and sync your data across multiple devices. I personally use the Mac desktop and Android versions every day.

If you're not using some kind of password manager stop reading here and go download one.

## [Alfred][2]

Alfred is another app I use many times a day, _every single day_. Aside from just launching apps quickly from a hotkey, you can also search your files for certain documents, look up word definitions or spelling. My personal favorite is using the calculator to perform quick math operations in order to check some game development math.

I cannot say enough good things about Alfred. The base version is free but you should [buy the Powerpack][22] in order to support the developer.

## [Balsamiq][3]

Excellent mockup app

## [Caffeine][4]

A very useful app which allows you to keep your Mac awake (or not) with a simple toggle in the menu bar.

## [ColorSnapper][5]

Need to grab an RGB or hex color value from anywhere on your screen? ColorSnapper does the job with a simple hotkey. In addition, it keeps a log of recently used color values which is super handy.

## [Daisy Disk][6]

Awesome visualizer for showing you what is taking up all your disk space.

## [Divvy][7]

The missing window manager for OSX! Very handy, global shortcuts rule for easily moving windows about.

## [DMGCanvas][8]

Great little app to help you build DMGs for distributing your games on Mac. I used it for Lava Blade.

## [DragonDrop][9]

Drag and drop files to this floating window holders.

## [f.lux][10]

Automatically adjusts screen brightness to coincide with time of day. Great for working at night.

## [Icon Slate][11]

Handy little app for creating .ico and .icns files, amoung others.

## [JollysFastVNC][12]

Great VNC client.

## [Kaleidoscope][13]

Awesome diff tool. Hook it up to git for awesomeness.

## [Less.app][14]

Automagically builds .less files.

## [Marked][15]

Best markdown viewer I've used.

## [Pixelmator][16]

Great photoshop alternative.

## [Private Eye][17]

Watch incoming/outgoing network requests.

## [Reggy][18]

RegEx tester!

## [Sublime Text 2][19]

Best text editor hands down.
