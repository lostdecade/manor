Remember [Asylum Night][1]? We made it a while ago as part of [Indie Speed Run][2], a 48-hour game jam. We were randomly given the theme "telepathy" and the element "booby-traps" which we had to use in the game. (It also needed to be mobile-friendly so we could license it to portal companies, an internal requirement.)

What we came up with is a weird riff on a game Geoff and I both love: Plants VS Zombies. And now the graphics in **Asylum Night** are free for anyone to use! The [license][3] is straight-forward: you can display, distribute, remix, profit, whatever you wanna do, please just attribute "Original artwork by Lost Decade Games" and we're solid.

[Get the graphics on Open Game Art][4]
