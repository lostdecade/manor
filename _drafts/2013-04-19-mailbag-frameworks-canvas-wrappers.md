We often get email from readers or podcast listeners asking to expand on certain topics. We feel most of these questions can be of value to all our readers so I'm going to start posting them Q&A style on the blog now and then. Without further ado, on to this installment of LDG Mailbag!

## JavaScript Frameworks

> Firstly, I notice you don’t appear to use any Javascript frameworks for your projects.  Is there a particular reason for this?  I tend to use MooTools for the majority of apps as it just means that things are a bit simpler and more straight forward to code but over the past few months have been wondering if this is the right thing to do.

My answer, blah blah blah

## Canvas vs DOM

> The canvas object is featured very heavily in your games.  I played about with canvas coding in 2010(ish) and was put off by the very limited support in some browsers.  I know that the baseline browser has significantly improved but does the canvas offer that much improvement over moving elements on the page?  Generally I will change the position of a div element (or similar) to move something but know the canvas can do this.

My answer blah blah blah

## Native mobile

> Finally I read the post about using the Game Closure framework to get Onslaught! Arena running on an iPad.  At the end of last year I had to develop my iPad orientated first web app (an interactive publication for a customer) and although I got quite a few things working OK such as finger swipes and similar, developing for the iPad clearly requires a slightly different approach to a regular web app.  To this end it’s an area that I’m really trying to push myself to learn more and possibly start developing some native apps.  Looking at the Game Closure site, it appears to basically be a development server for static html5 applications and a fully fledged JS framework, plus a compiler.  Did you have to recode parts of your game using their framework or did it largely just import in OK?  Are there any pitfalls you found when using it?

My answer, blah blah blah
