<p>
	We're a tiny independent game studio (just <a href="/about/">two guys</a> right now) and only want to make great games, not upset anyone. We promise that:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>we will <strong>never</strong> spam you…</li>
	<li>we will <strong>never</strong> disclose your personal information without your permission (unless required by law)…</li>
	<li>we will <strong>protect</strong> your information from other users.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We may sell, rent or share information about user habits, but only in <strong>anonymous aggregate</strong>. We will never do so in a manner that could even remotely be individually identifiable.
	For example, we might aggregate data like, "out of 1,000 players, 25% played for 5 minutes," but wouldn't expose any individual person's specific data.
