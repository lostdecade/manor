<p>
	<strong>Onslaught!</strong> is the spiritual successor to <a href="/onslaught_arena/">Onslaught! Arena</a>.
	Originally a pure HTML5 game, <strong>Onslaught!</strong> is now available
	on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onslaught!/id441426241">iPad</a>
	thanks to the <a href="http://gameclosure.com/">Game Closure</a> SDK.
</p>

<p>
	The basic gameplay mechanics, creature behaviors and everything else from <a href="/onslaught_arena/">Onslaught! Arena</a>
	is still here, but we also added <strong>new enemies</strong>, <strong>new environments</strong> and a <strong>store with awesome gear</strong> for your playing pleasure.
	While it's not <em>quite</em> a sequel, we wanted to add enough new content to be worth a look on these new mobile platforms.
